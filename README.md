# DemoTestSeleniumProject Project with TestNG for Automating Tests on Demo Ecommerce Website 

This is a Java project that uses Selenium WebDriver and TestNG to automate tests on an ecommerce website. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

## Project Structure
The project has the following structure:

src/test: This folder contains the Java classes that define the test cases.
src/main/pages: This folder contains the Java classes that define the page objects for the ecommerce website.
testng.xml: This file contains the TestNG configuration for the test suite.
## Test Cases
The test cases are defined in the src/test/ folder. The following are the test cases that are included in this project:

1. **LoginTest:** These test cases log in to the ecommerce website using valid and invalid credentials and verifies whether the login was successful or unsuccessfully.
2. **ProductTest:** These test cases sort products, adding products to product badge, as well removing from cart badge and verify that results displayed correctly.
3. **HamburgerMenuTest:** These test cases verify whether the "hamburger" menu is clickable and listed successfully.
4. **CartTest:** This test case adds a product to the cart and verifies that the product is added correctly.
5. **CheckoutTest:** This test cases check out a product with valid and invalid data and verify whether the checkout process is completed successfully or unsuccessfully.
All test cases are designed to run in sequence, following the logical flow of a typical ecommerce website interaction.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your IDE.
3. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
4. Open testng.xml and run the test suite.
5. You can find the test cases [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CxgZJ5MrGwNLegS7420FXifWnMb_-fQn/edit#gid=1108930397) on Google Drive.
